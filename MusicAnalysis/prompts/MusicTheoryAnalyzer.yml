"detect_key":
  |
    Determine the musical key of the given composition.
    Identify whether it is in a major or minor scale and specify the key (e.g., C Major, A Minor).
    If the composition follows an Indian classical raga system, return the equivalent raga name (e.g., Raag Yaman, Raag Bhairav) else return No_Raag.
    If the key is ambiguous, return unknown.
      examples:
        C Major||No_Raag
        C Major||No_Raag
        C Minor||No_Raag
        C# Minor||No_Raag
        B Minor||No_Raag
        E Minor||No_Raag
        B Major||No_Raag
        C Minor||No_Raag
        unknown
    DO NOT return the whole summery or analysis only return the output as given in the example
    do not put indentation in the answer

"detect_chords":
  |
    Analyze the given music piece and extract the chord progressions used.
    Identify common chord progressions such as I-IV-V-I in Western music or equivalent harmonic structures in jazz, pop, and rock.
    If the composition follows Indian classical music, return the harmonic texture if applicable.
    Provide chord names (e.g., C-G-Am-F) and their respective notations.
    examples:
      C-G-Am-F (I-V-vi-IV)
      D-A-Bm-G (I-V-vi-IV)
      E7-A7-B7 (Blues Progression)
      Raag Bhairav – No chord-based harmony detected

    DO NOT return the whole summery or analysis only return the output as given in the example
    do not put indentation in the answer

"detect_scales":
  |
    Identify the musical scale or mode used in the composition.
    For Western music, detect whether it follows major, minor, pentatonic, blues, or modal scales (e.g., Dorian, Phrygian).
    For Indian classical music, determine the raga scale (e.g., Raag Yaman, Raag Hamsadhwani) and its arohana (ascending) and avarohana (descending) patterns.
    If the scale is ambiguous, return unknown.
    examples:
      C Major Scale: C-D-E-F-G-A-B
      A Minor Scale: A-B-C-D-E-F-G
      Blues Scale: E-G-A-Bb-B-D
      Raag Hamsadhwani: C-D-E-G-A (Arohana), A-G-E-D-C (Avarohana)

"detect_cadences":
  |
    Analyze the composition for cadences and identify the type used.
    Detect perfect (V-I), imperfect (I-V), plagal (IV-I), and deceptive (V-vi) cadences in Western classical music.
    If applicable, describe any cadence-like phrase endings in jazz, pop, or Indian classical music.
    If no cadence patterns are detected, return 
    examples:
      Perfect Cadence: G Major (V) → C Major (I)
      Imperfect Cadence: C Major (I) → G Major (V)
      Deceptive Cadence: G Major (V) → A Minor (vi)
      no_cadence_detected
